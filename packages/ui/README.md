pnpm lint:fix           # Fix ESLint issues automatically
pnpm format             # Format code with Prettier
pnpm format:check       # Check code formatting

# Testing
pnpm test               # Run test suite (when implemented)

```

## Routing

This application uses TanStack Router for type-safe routing:

Routes are automatically code-split for optimal loading performance.

## API Integration

The `src/services/api.ts` file provides a configured API client:

```typescript
import { api } from './services/api';

// Example usage
const health = await api.get('/health');
```

The API base URL is automatically configured to work with the backend API.

## Styling

### Tailwind CSS
This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Key features:
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Responsive design utilities
- Dark mode support (when implemented)
- Custom component classes

### Component Development
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Implement responsive design from mobile-first
- Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility

## Development Tips

1. **Type Safety**: All routes are type-safe with TanStack Router
2. **Hot Reload**: Changes are instantly reflected in the browser
3. **Component Dev**: Use React DevTools for debugging
4. **Performance**: Vite provides built-in performance optimizations

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory with:
- Minified JavaScript and CSS
- Tree-shaken dependencies
- Gzipped assets
- Automatic code splitting

## Deployment

The `dist/` folder can be deployed to any static hosting service:
- Vercel
- Netlify 
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- GitHub Pages

For SPA routing, ensure your hosting service redirects all routes to `index.html`.
